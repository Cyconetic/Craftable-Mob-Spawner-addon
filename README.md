# Craftable-Mob-Spawner-addon
This a Minecraft mod for bedrock edition which allows for monster spawners and trial spawners to be crafted. It also makes it so that mob eggs can be dropped by certain mobs. I have released this so that you can download the modpack and also use it as source code for any projects your working on.
Overall this mod adds 1 new block, the "Cage", and two new items, the "Spawner Amulet" and the "Trial Amulet".
It also makes all hostile mobs that aren't bosses (including mini-bosses like Elder Guardains and Wardens), humanoid (all the pillagers including ravengers because then saddles would be farmable), creakings or wither skeletons.
For more of an overview check out my video on the mod here:
